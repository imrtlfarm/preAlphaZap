In each individual swap, the caller determines either the amount of tokens sent to or received from the Pool, depending on the `kind` value. Returns an array with the net Vault asset balance deltas. Positive amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent to the Vault, and negative amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent by the Vault. Each delta corresponds to the asset at the same index in the `assets` array. Swaps are executed sequentially, in the order specified by the `swaps` array. Each array element describes a Pool, the token to be sent to this Pool, the token to receive from it, and an amount that is either `amountIn` or `amountOut` depending on the swap kind. Multihop swaps can be executed by passing an `amount` value of zero for a swap. This will cause the amount in/out of the previous swap to be used as the amount in for the current one. In a 'given in' swap, 'tokenIn' must equal the previous swap's `tokenOut`. For a 'given out' swap, `tokenOut` must equal the previous swap's `tokenIn`. The `assets` array contains the addresses of all assets involved in the swaps. These are either token addresses, or the IAsset sentinel value for ETH (the zero address). Each entry in the `swaps` array specifies tokens in and out by referencing an index in `assets`. Note that Pools never interact with ETH directly: it will be wrapped to or unwrapped from WETH by the Vault. Internal Balance usage, sender, and recipient are determined by the `funds` struct. The `limits` array specifies the minimum or maximum amount of each token the vault is allowed to transfer. `batchSwap` can be used to make a single swap, like `swap` does, but doing so requires more gas than the equivalent `swap` call. Emits `Swap` events."

A deregistered token can be re-registered later on, possibly with a different Asset Manager. Emits a `TokensDeregistered` event."

This will trigger custom Pool behavior, which will typically ask for something in return from `sender` - often tokenized Pool shares. The amount of tokens that can be withdrawn is limited by the Pool's `cash` balance (see `getPoolTokenInfo`). If the caller is not `sender`, it must be an authorized relayer for them. The `tokens` and `minAmountsOut` arrays must have the same length, and each entry in these indicates the minimum token amount to receive for each token contract. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault: it just enforces these minimums. If exiting a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to receive ETH directly: the Vault will do the unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is not possible to combine ETH and WETH in the same exit. `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If receiving ETH however, the array must be sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the final `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be exited. If `toInternalBalance` is true, the tokens will be deposited to `recipient`'s Internal Balance. Otherwise, an ERC20 transfer will be performed. Note that ETH cannot be deposited to Internal Balance: attempting to do so will trigger a revert. `minAmountsOut` is the minimum amount of tokens the user expects to get out of the Pool, for each token in the `tokens` array. This array must match the Pool's registered tokens. This causes the Vault to call the `IBasePool.onExitPool` hook on the Pool's contract, where Pools implement their own custom logic. This typically requires additional information from the user (such as the expected number of Pool shares to return). This can be encoded in the `userData` argument, which is ignored by the Vault and passed directly to the Pool's contract. Emits a `PoolBalanceChanged` event."

The Pool's total balance for `token` equals the sum of `cash` and `managed`. Internally, `cash` and `managed` are stored using 112 bits. No action can ever cause a Pool's token `cash`, `managed` or `total` balance to be greater than 2^112 - 1. `lastChangeBlock` is the number of the block in which `token`'s total balance was last modified (via either a join, exit, swap, or Asset Manager update). This value is useful to avoid so-called 'sandwich attacks', for example when developing price oracles. A change of zero (e.g. caused by a swap with amount zero) is considered a change for this purpose, and will update `lastChangeBlock`. `assetManager` is the Pool's token Asset Manager."

Calls to `registerTokens` and `deregisterTokens` may change this order. If a Pool only registers tokens once, and these are sorted in ascending order, they will be stored in the same order as passed to `registerTokens`. Total balances include both tokens held by the Vault and those withdrawn by the Pool's Asset Managers. These are the amounts used by joins, exits and swaps.

The `assets` and `maxAmountsIn` arrays must have the same length, and each entry indicates the maximum amount to send for each asset. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault: it just enforces these maximums. If joining a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to send ETH directly: the Vault will do the wrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is not possible to combine ETH and WETH in the same join. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is important for relayers). `assets` must have the same length and order as the aHrray returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If sending ETH however, the array must be sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ET sentinel value (the zero address), which means the final `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be joined. If `fromInternalBalance` is true, the caller's Internal Balance will be preferred: ERC20 transfers will only be made for the difference between the requested amount and Internal Balance (if any).

Each element in the array corresponds to the asset at the same index, and indicates the number of tokens (or ETH) the Vault would take from the sender (if positive) or send to the recipient (if negative). The arguments it receives are the same that an equivalent `batchSwap` call would receive. Unlike `batchSwap`, this function performs no checks on the sender or recipient field in the `funds` struct. This makes it suitable to be called by off-chain applications via eth_call without needing to hold tokens, approve them for the Vault, or even know a user's address. Note that this function is not 'view' (due to implementation details): the client code must explicitly execute eth_call instead of eth_sendTransaction."

For Pools with the Two Token specialization, `tokens` must have a length of two, that is, both tokens must be registered in the same `registerTokens` call, and they must be sorted in ascending order. The `tokens` and `assetManagers` arrays must have the same length, and each entry in these indicates the Asset Manager for the corresponding token. Asset Managers can manage a Pool's tokens via `managePoolBalance`, depositing and withdrawing them directly, and can even set their balance to arbitrary amounts. They are therefore expected to be highly secured smart contracts with sound design principles, and the decision to register an Asset Manager should not be made lightly. Pools can choose not to assign an Asset Manager to a given token by passing in the zero address. Once an Asset Manager is set, it cannot be changed except by deregistering the associated token and registering again with a different Asset Manager. Emits a `TokensRegistered` event."
